        interactive simulations, and ultimately contribute to building skils in product design.</p>

    <h2>Design Statement</h2>
    <h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
        <p> When college students interested in the STEM career fields want to explore their options and seek to learn more about a specific career, they need an app that will help them gain insightful knowledge and real-world experience that a standard post-secondary education curriculum might not.</p>
        </p>
    </br>
        <h1>Segment Of Interest:</h1>
        <p> Our segment of interest is college students who are getting ready to enter the workforce, with a focus on becoming a product designer as a career. 
        </p>
    </br>
        <h1>Mandatories:</h1>
        <p>Our designed object must contain an intuitive career pathway with the necessary skills and experience a product designer will need, as well as a way to network and gain advice from real-world professionals. The designed object must avoid incomprehensible information that is difficult to digest

            <p>A lot of the students our group conducted interviews on were computer science majors</p>
